Charging cable
Additional large band
The detachable bands on FitBit come in a variety of colors and materials, sold
separately.

Charge your watch
A fully-charged FitBit has a battery life of 6+ days. Battery life and charge cycles
vary with use and other factors; actual results will vary.
To charge FitBit:
1. Plug the charging cable into the USB port on your computer, a UL-certified
USB wall charger, or another low-energy charging device.
2. Hold the other end of the charging cable near the port on the back of the
watch until it attaches magnetically. Make sure the pins on the charging cable
align with the port on the back of your watch.

Charge FitBit for 12 minutes for 24 hours of battery life. While the watch charges,
tap the screen twice or press the button to turn the screen on. The battery level
appears for several seconds, then disappears so you can use your watch while it
charges. Charging fully takes about 1-2 hours.

Set up FitBit
Set up FitBit with the Fitbit app for iPhones and iPads or Android phones. The
Fitbit app is compatible with most popular phones. See fitbit.com/devices to check
if your phone is compatible.
To get started:
1. Download the Fitbit app: Apple App Store for iPhones and Google Play Store for Android phones
2. Install the app, and open it.
3. Tap Sign in with Google, and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your
device.
When you're done with setup, read through the guide to learn more about your new
watch and then explore the Fitbit app.

Connect to Wi-Fi
During setup, you're prompted to connect FitBit to your Wi-Fi network. FitBit
uses Wi-Fi to more quickly download apps from the Fitbit Gallery and for faster,
more reliable OS updates.
FitBit can connect to open, WEP, WPA personal, and WPA2 personal Wi-Fi
networks. Your watch won't connect to 5GHz, WPA enterprise, or public Wi-Fi
networks that require more than a password to connect-for example, logins,
subscriptions, or profiles. If you see fields for a username or domain when
connecting to the Wi-Fi network on a computer, the network isn't supported.
For best results, connect FitBit to your home Wi-Fi network. Make sure you know
the network password before connecting.

See your data in the Fitbit app
Open the Fitbit app on your phone to see your health metrics, activity and sleep
data, choose a workout or mindfulness session, and more.

Unlock Fitbit Premium
Fitbit Premium is your personalized resource in the Fitbit app that helps you stay
active, sleep well, and manage stress. A Premium subscription includes programs
tailored to your health and fitness goals, personalized insights, hundreds of
workouts from fitness brands, guided meditations, and more.
Customers can redeem a Fitbit Premium trial subscription in the Fitbit app.
For more information, see the related help article.

Wear FitBit
Wear FitBit around your wrist. If you need to attach a different size band, or if you
purchased another band, see the instructions in "Change the band" on page 15.
Placement for all-day wear vs. exercise
When you're not exercising, wear FitBit a finger's width above your wrist bone.
In general, it's always important to give your wrist a break on a regular basis by
removing your watch for around an hour after extended wear. We recommend
removing your watch while you shower. Although you can shower while wearing
your watch, not doing so reduces the potential for exposure to soaps, shampoos,
and conditioners, which can cause long-term damage to your watch and may cause
skin irritation.
For optimized heart-rate tracking while exercising:
During workouts, try moving the band higher on your wrist to get a better fit.
If you experience any discomfort, loosen the band, and if it persists give your
wrist a break by taking it off.
Wear your watch on top of your wrist, and make sure the back of the device is
in contact with your skin.

Fasten the band
1. Place FitBit around your wrist.
2. Slide the bottom band through the first loop in the top band.
3. Tighten the band until it fits comfortably, and press the peg through one of
the holes in the band.
4. Slide the loose end of the band through the second loop until it lies flat on
your wrist. Make sure the band isn't too tight. Wear the band loosely enough
that it can move back and forth on your wrist.

Handedness
For greater accuracy, you must specify whether you wear FitBit on your dominant
or non-dominant hand. Your dominant hand is the one you use for writing and
eating. To start, the Wrist setting is set to non-dominant. If you wear FitBit on
your dominant hand, change the Wrist setting in the Fitbit app:
From the Today tab
Wrist > Dominant.
in the Fitbit app, tap the icon in the top left > FitBit tile

Wear and care tips
Clean your band and wrist regularly with a soap-free cleanser.
If your watch gets wet, remove and dry it completely after your activity.
Take your watch off from time to time.
If you notice skin irritation, remove your watch and contact customer support.
For more information, see fitbit.com/productcare.
For more information, visit the Fitbit Wear & Care page.

Change the band
FitBit comes with a small band attached and an additional large, bottom band in
the box. Both the top and bottom bands can be swapped with accessory bands,
sold separately on fitbit.com. For band measurements, see "Band size" on page 72.
Fitbit Sense bands are compatible with FitBit.
Remove a band
1. Turn over FitBit and find the band latches.
2. To release the latch, slide the flat button toward the band.
3. Gently pull the band away from the watch to release it.
4. Repeat on the other side.
Attach a band
To attach a band, press it into the end of the watch until you hear a click and it
snaps into place. The band with the loops and peg attaches to the top of the watch.
